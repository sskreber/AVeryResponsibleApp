/**
* This app is designed to track the user's alcohol and water/soft drink intake. 
* Water is used to refer to both water and soft drinks here, as the component of water is the vital point here. 
* The soft drink button has a lower score than the water button, the latter being "more concentrated water". 
* It is also designed to keep the user hydrated. Each alcohol intake incurs a score rise on the water side too, 
* as the latter keeps track of the water intake "needed". 
* The user is complimented, advised or warned (in the form of toast messages) on each button press based on their overall alcohol score,
* their overall water score, and on the proportion of the two. 
*
* Very high alcohol intake trigger serious warning messages no matter the water intake. 
* (=User drank way too much alcohol.)
* High alcohol intake and high water "needed" trigger somewhat less serious warning messages and advices. 
* (=User drank a lot, and has a high water "debt".)
* High alcohol intake and low water intake "needed" trigger advices on drinking more water, not alcohol. 
* (User drank a lot of alcohol, but a lot of water too - their water "debt" is low.)
* Low alcohol intake and high water intake "needed" trigger compliments and, as the water intake itself increases, humorous lines.
(= User drinks little to no alcohol, and drinks a lot of water.) 
* Lines for the latter case: "With great power comes great responsibility.", "Not judging you. Honest."

* There is an "UNDO" button for each intake button (for both alcohol and water), 
* to take back an added score if drinking button was pressed by accident. This is a drinking app after all.
